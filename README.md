The Local Event Finder Application should run without much effort. 
Once the program is ran through and debugged, the application should open and run.
You can register a new user with your own username and password.
However, a premade user is:
    Username: user
    Password: password123

Attached within the submitted files is a file of screenshots showing the troubles we went through connecting the API to the application.
